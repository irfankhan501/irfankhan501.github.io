    <h1>Stoicism: The Way Of Life</h1>

    <h2>I. What Is Stoicism?</h2>
    <p>
      The private diaries of one of Rome’s greatest emperors, the personal
      letters of one of Rome’s best playwrights and wisest power brokers, the
      lectures of a former slave and exile, turned influential teacher. Against
      all odds, some two millennia later, these incredible documents survive.
      They contain some of the greatest wisdom in the history of the world and
      together, they constitute the bedrock of what is known as Stoicism—an
      ancient philosophy that was once one of the most popular civic disciplines
      in the West, practiced by the rich and the impoverished, the powerful and
      the struggling alike in the pursuit of the Good Life. <br />
      <br />
      Except to the most avid seekers of wisdom, Stoicism is either unknown or
      misunderstood. To the average person, this vibrant, action-oriented, and
      paradigm-shifting way of living has become shorthand for
      “emotionlessness.” Given the fact that the mere mention of philosophy
      makes most nervous or bored, “Stoic philosophy” on the surface sounds like
      the last thing anyone would want to learn about, let alone urgently need
      in the course of daily life. <br />
      <br />
      It would be hard to find a word that dealt a greater injustice at the
      hands of the English language than “Stoic.” In its rightful place,
      Stoicism is a tool in the pursuit of self-mastery, perseverance, and
      wisdom: something one uses to live a great life, rather than some esoteric
      field of academic inquiry. Certainly, many of history’s great minds not
      only understood Stoicism for what it truly is, they sought it out: George
      Washington, Walt Whitman, Frederick the Great, Eugène Delacroix, Adam
      Smith, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Jefferson, Matthew Arnold, Ambrose Bierce,
      Theodore Roosevelt, William Alexander Percy, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Each
      read, studied, quoted, or admired the Stoics. The ancient Stoics
      themselves were no slouches. The names you encounter on this site in our
      daily email meditations—Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca—belonged to,
      respectively, a Roman emperor, a former slave who triumphed to become an
      influential lecturer and friend of the emperor Hadrian, and a famous
      playwright and political adviser. <br /><br />
      What have all these and countless other great men and women found within
      Stoicism that others missed? A great deal. Primarily, that it provides
      much needed strength, wisdom, and stamina for all of life’s challenges.
